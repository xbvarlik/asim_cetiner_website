# Specification Quality Checklist: Admin mobile layout and navigation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-05  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation notes**: Specification describes navigation and layout outcomes (compact menu, no horizontal scroll, progressive disclosure) without naming stacks or libraries. **Key Entities** omitted intentionally—no new data concepts.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation notes**: Success criteria reference “narrow screen representative of common smartphone portrait use” and acceptance test documentation rather than framework-specific metrics. Out-of-scope public pages called out in edge cases and FR-007.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation notes**: User stories P1–P3 map to navigation shell, list/detail patterns, and forms; FRs align with those journeys. Stakeholder qualitative bar included in SC-004.

## Notes

- Checklist completed after spec iteration: viewport wording in Success Criteria and Assumptions was adjusted to stay technology-agnostic while preserving measurable acceptance.
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if open questions arise) or `/speckit.plan`.
