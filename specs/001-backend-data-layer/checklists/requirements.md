# Specification Quality Checklist: Backend Data Layer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Last validated**: 2026-03-19 (post-clarification)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Technology references (PostgreSQL, Prisma, Supabase) are confined to the
  Assumptions section since this feature is inherently about data infrastructure.
- 5 clarifications resolved via `/speckit.clarify` session on 2026-03-19.
- All 16/16 checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
